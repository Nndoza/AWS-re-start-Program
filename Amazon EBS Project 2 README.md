# ðŸ“‚ Project 2: Working with Amazon EBS
## Overview
This project delves into the fundamental aspects of Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), a scalable and high-performance block-storage service for Amazon EC2. The objective was to gain practical experience in the lifecycle management of EBS volumes, from creation and attachment to an EC2 instance, to creating snapshots for data protection and restoring volumes from those snapshots. This hands-on lab provided crucial insights into persistent storage solutions in the AWS Cloud.

## Project Objectives
The key objectives for this lab project were:
- Create an EBS volume: To provision a new block storage device in AWS.
- Attach and mount an EBS volume to an EC2 instance: To connect the newly created storage to a running virtual server and make it accessible to the operating system.
- Create a snapshot of an EBS volume: To create a point-in-time backup of the volume's data for durability and recovery purposes.
- Create an EBS volume from a snapshot: To restore data from a previously created snapshot into a new, usable EBS volume.
