# ðŸ“‚ Project 6: Creating Amazon EC2 Instances
## Overview
This project focused on exploring multiple methods for launching Amazon EC2, a core compute service in AWS. The objective was to gain hands-on experience in deploying EC2 instances using both the AWS Management Console and the AWS Command Line Interface, including connecting to them securely. This lab provided practical insights into different deployment strategies and the programmatic control of AWS resources.

## ðŸŽ¯Project Objectives
- Launch an EC2 instance by using the AWS Management Console: To deploy a virtual server through the graphical user interface.
- Connect to the EC2 instance by using EC2 Instance Connect: To establish a secure browser-based connection to the instance without needing SSH keys.
- Launch an EC2 instance by using the AWS CLI: To deploy a virtual server programmatically, demonstrating automation capabilities.
