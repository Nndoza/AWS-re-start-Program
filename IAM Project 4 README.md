# ðŸ“‚ Project 4: Introduction to AWS Identity and Access Management

## Overview
This project provided a comprehensive introduction to AWS IAM, a fundamental service for securely controlling access to AWS resources. The core objective was to explore and apply IAM concepts such as users, user groups, and policies to manage permissions effectively. This hands-on lab simulated a real-world scenario of assigning different levels of access based on job functions, reinforcing the importance of security and access control in the cloud.

## Project Objectives
- Create and apply an IAM password policy: To enforce security best practices for user authentication across the AWS account.
- Explore pre-created IAM users and user groups: To understand the structure and benefits of organizing users into groups for easier permission management.
- Inspect IAM policies as applied to the pre-created user groups: To analyze how policies define specific permissions (Allow/Deny actions on resources).
- Add users to user groups with specific capabilities active: To practically assign permissions to users by associating them with relevant user groups.
- Locate and use the IAM sign-in URL: To understand and utilize the dedicated login portal for IAM users.
- Experiment with the effects of policies on service access: To verify that the assigned permissions correctly restrict or allow access to AWS services (e.g., S3, EC2).
