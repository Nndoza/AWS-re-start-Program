# üìöOverview 

This repository serves as a showcase of the hands-on projects I completed during the intensive AWS re/Start program. Through these practical exercises, I've built a strong foundation in cloud computing and gained valuable experience in designing, deploying, and managing solutions on Amazon Web Services.

## ‚òÅÔ∏èMy projects demonstrate a range of skills, including:

### Database Management & Application Integration: In Project 1: 

Build Your DB Server and Interact With Your DB Using an App, I gained hands-on experience deploying and configuring database servers, ensuring secure connectivity, and integrating them with applications.
