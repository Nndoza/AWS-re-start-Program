# üìöOverview 

This repository serves as a showcase of the hands-on projects I completed during the intensive AWS re/Start program. Through these practical exercises, I've built a strong foundation in cloud computing and gained valuable experience in designing, deploying, and managing solutions on Amazon Web Services.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Key Skills Demonstrated Across Projects
Through these projects, I've gained practical experience and solidified my understanding in several core cloud domains:

#### Cloud Infrastructure & Compute
- Managing Amazon EC2 instances and designing isolated network environments using Amazon VPC, including subnets, Internet Gateways, NAT Gateways, Route Tables, and DNS.

#### Data Storage & Management
-  Deploying highly available Amazon RDS databases (Multi-AZ), and managing Amazon EBS volumes with snapshots for data protection. I also gained experience with Linux file system management.

#### Security & Access Control
- Implementing Security Groups to control traffic and applying the Principle of Least Privilege.

#### Automation & Deployment
- Understanding Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles and configuring web server deployments on EC2.

## üìÅProjects & Learning Outcomes
### Project 1: Build Your DB Server and Interact With Your DB Using an App
Learned: Deploying highly available Amazon RDS databases, configuring secure connections between web servers and databases, and validating end to end application to database interaction.

### Project 2: Working with Amazon EBS
Learned: The full lifecycle management of EBS volumes, including creation, attachment, mounting, and critical data protection strategies using snapshots and volume restoration.

### Project 3: Build Your VPC and Launch a Web Server
Learned: Designing and implementing custom, secure network architectures within AWS VPCs, configuring routing, and successfully deploying a publicly accessible web server.

This portfolio demonstrates my hands-on capability in foundational AWS services and my commitment to building well-architected cloud solutions.
